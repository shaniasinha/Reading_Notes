# Welcome to SS's Reading Summaries!

### Purpose:
- [ ] To track the books and papers I read, and making meaningful notes.
- [ ] To get better at using Obsidian (with git)
- [ ] To learn and get better at using the Zettelkasten (literally: smart notes?) method to track my thoughts and enable easy writing. 

### Background:
This project started in the late hours of 12 October, 2023. The author is currently on a gap (unintentionally but she wants to make it intentional). Although she knew how easily time slips from one's hands, it is more obvious to her now. Days can pass and the only activity the author partakes in is watching YouTube, Netflix and/or going to the gym (apart from 'basic life stuff'). 

### Plan:


**P.S.:** It is kind of fun writing about myself in third person. I see why people do it on LinkedIn now. How seemingly self-important! I need some of that confidence right now.
